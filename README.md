This repository contains the source code for a Discordbot Core with GPT3 integration. This Discordbot Core is designed to use the GPT-3 API provided by OpenAI to 
generate natural-sounding messages from user input. Using the GPT-3 API, the Discordbot Core can understand natural language input and generate appropriate responses. 

This repository starts now and will grow by time. Due to the modular architecture, SLASH-Commands can be added. 



### Tree
- `src`
  - `deploy-commands.js` Actual used with `node ./src/deploy-commands.js` to deploy new commands. 
  - `main.js` The main file containing the code for the Discordbot Core:
    - `commands` This folder contains all slash-commandfiles. New commandfiles can be stored here. 
      - `openAI.js` Slash-command file for the GPT3 request.
      - `ping.js` Slash-command for a simple 'Ping' - 'PONG!'
- `.env` Configuration. Keyvalues need to be edited before use
- `package.json` Package file. Use `npm i` to install necessary packages.
- `README.md` This file containing information about the repository.



## Getting Started
To get started with the Discordbot Core and GPT3 integration, you will need to install the necessary dependencies and configure the .env file.

1. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

    
    
2. Configure the bot:
    - Set the TOKEN, IDs and API_KEY in the `.env` file.

3. start your bot:
```
node ./src/main.js
```

## Usage
in Discord: `/gpt <your task for gpt to do>`

You can use natural language input to interact with the bot. For example, you can ask the bot questions like 
```
/gpt tell me a story of a koala leaving to new york` and the bot will generate an appropriate response.
```


## Adding new slash-commands
Create a new .js-file in `./src/commands/` and ensure to use following blueprint to ensure your command will be included correct.

```
const { SlashCommandBuilder }       = require('@discordjs/builders');
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi }  = require('openai');
const { config }                    = require("dotenv"); config();
const OPENAI_API_KEY  = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
const configuration   = new Configuration({ apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY, });
const openai          = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

module.exports = {
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()                                 
        .setName('yourcommandname')                                         // REPLACE yourcommandname                                                
        .setDescription('Your command description to help the user. :)'),   // REPLACE your description          

    // the slash command itself
    execute(interaction) {
              
          // ---------------------------------------------------------------This is where all your code can be placed
       
         } 
}
```
After creating your slash-command.js file use the deploy-commands.js to send the updated commands to your bot. 
```
npm ./src/deploy-commands.js
```
